        <p class="card-text">The Department of Computer Science initiated a software development firm to function as a concept live lab.  This ongoing structure is called RLabZ meaning “Rajagiri Labs”. The primary purpose to initiate the venture was to benefit the students to be a part of the real working environment and earn while they learn. This also facilitated the faculty to take up software consultancy projects.
          This data was well reflected in CII AICTE survey and has earned us platinum in the Survey 2017 and subsequently in 2018.
          This Startup would stay as Rajagiri Software Team in practice.The College is equipped with 461 computers and 9 Servers that provide various services from Active Domain Control to Custom Learning Environment.
